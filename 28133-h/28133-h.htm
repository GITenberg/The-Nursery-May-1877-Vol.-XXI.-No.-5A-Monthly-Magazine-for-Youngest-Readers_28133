</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ALLACE is a boy about ten years old, who
lives in a town near Boston. He has
a brother Charles, eighteen years of age.
These two brothers are the town lamplighters.</div>

<p>There are at least fifty lamps to be lighted every night;
and some of them are a good deal farther apart than the
street-lamps in large cities. Charles takes the more distant
ones for his part of the work, and drives from post to post
in a gig.</p>

<p>Wallace, being a small boy, calls to his aid his father's
saddle-horse. This horse is a kind, gentle creature, and as
wise as he is kind. He and Wallace are about the same
age, and have always been good friends.</p>

<p>So when Wallace puts the saddle on him every evening,
just before dark, the horse knows just what is going to be
done. He looks at the boy with his great bright eyes, as
much as to say, "We have our evening work to do, haven't
we, Wallace? Well, I'm ready: jump on."</p>

<p>Wallace mounts the horse; and they go straight to the
nearest lamp-post. Here the horse stops close by the post,
and stands as still and steady as the post itself.</p>

<p>Then Wallace stands upright on the saddle, takes a match
from his pocket, lights the lamp, drops quickly into his seat
again, takes up the bridle, gives the word to the horse, and
on they go to the next lamp-post.</p>

<p>So they go on, till all the lamps allotted to Wallace are
lighted. Then they trot home merrily, and, before Wallace
goes to bed himself, I am sure he does not forget to see that
his good horse is well fed and cared for.</p>

<p>This is a true story.</p>

<h2>FOURTH LESSON IN ASTRONOMY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Because</span> our earth has one sun and one moon, you may
think all earths have only one; but wise men have looked
through their telescopes, and have discovered that some of
the stars which look to us like single stars are really double;
and many of them are clusters of three or four, all lighting
up the same planets.</p>

<p>Those earths, then, have more than one sun: they have
two, three, or four, as the case may be. Think of two suns.
How bright it must be! And imagine one of them red, and
the other blue, as some of them are. Wouldn't you feel as
if you were living in a rainbow?</p>

<p>And how would you like to look out of the window in
the evening and see four moons? The wise men can see
through their telescopes that Jupiter has four and Saturn
eight. (You remember I told you Jupiter and Saturn are
two of the earths lighted up by our sun.) Shouldn't you
think so many moons would make the nights so bright that
one could hardly go to sleep?</p>

<p>On the whole, I think we get along very well as we are;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and I hope the people who live in the brightness of two
suns have strong eyes given them. It must be very beautiful,
though. Perhaps you can get an idea how it seems to
have a red sun, if you look through a piece of red glass; but
I do not believe we can any of us imagine what it would be
like to have two suns of different colors.</p>

<p>Do you think a red sun shining on a moon makes a red
moon? A colored sun or a colored moon seems very strange
to us; but I suppose the people that are used to them would
think our white light strange.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the two suns rise and set at the same
time. But we may all wonder and wonder. Nobody knows
much about it. I hope you will all look at a double star
through a telescope, if you ever have an opportunity.</p>

<h2>"POPPING CORN."</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Bring</span> a yellow ear of corn, and then rub, rub, rub,<br />
Till the kernels rattle off from the nub, nub, nub!<br />
Then put them in a hopper made of wire, wire, wire,<br />
And set the little hopper on the fire, fire, fire!<br />
If you find them getting lively, give a shake, shake, shake;<br />
And a very pretty clatter they will make, make, make:<br />
You will hear the heated grains going pop, pop, pop;<br />
All about the little hopper, going hop, hop, hop!<br />
When you see the yellow corn turning white, white, white,<br />
You may know that the popping is done right, right, right:<br />
When the hopper gets too full, you may know, know, know,<br />
That the fire has changed your corn into snow, snow, snow:<br />
Turn the snow into a dish, for it is done, done, done;<br />
Then pass it round and eat&mdash;for that's the fun, fun, fun!<br />

<h2>THE POOR BLIND WOMAN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> a true story to tell about a colored woman who
lives in the city of Salem, not far from Boston.</p>

<p>She is old and poor and blind. She has had a husband
and six children; but they are all dead; her last remaining
son was killed in the war, and she is now quite alone in
the world.</p>

<p>But she is a cheerful old body. She does not whine, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
complain, nor beg; though she needs help much, and is
very thankful for any help that is given her.</p>

<p>When she goes out to walk, she finds her way as well as
she can by groping about with her big umbrella. Very
often she loses her way, and goes in the wrong direction;
and sometimes she gets bewildered: but I have never known
her to be really lost or hurt. There is always somebody to
set her right; and it is pleasant to see how kind every one
is to her.</p>

<p>Many a time I have seen some gentleman, while hurrying
to catch his train, stop to help her over the crossing; or
some handsomely-dressed lady take her by the arm, and set
her right, when she has gone astray.</p>

<p>Best of all it is, though, to see the children so kind to her.
She comes to our square every Saturday; and, as she is very
apt to go to the wrong gate, the little girls&mdash;bless their
dear hearts!&mdash;seem to consider it their duty to guide her,
and to help her over the slippery places.</p>

<p>In the picture, you may see Lily helping the poor old
woman along, as I often see her from my window. Another
day it may be Lina, and the next time Mamie; for they are
all good to her. Even baby Robin runs to meet her, and is
not afraid of her black face.</p>

<p>Last week, these small folks had a fair for her in Lily's
house. Nobody thought they would get so much money;
but they made fifty dollars out of it. This will make the
old woman comfortable for a long time.</p>

<p>The good woman said, when she was told what they had
done, that she hoped the Lord would reward them, for she
could not.</p>

<p>I think he has rewarded them already by making them
very happy while they were doing this kind deed.</p>

<h2>THE COOPER'S SONG.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">I am</span> the cooper: I bind the cask:<br />
The sweat flows down as I drive my task;<br />
Yet on with the hoop! And merry's the sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As I featly pound,</span><br />
And with block and hammer go travelling round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And round and round.</span><br />
<br />
I am the cooper: I bind the cask;<br />
And gay as play is my nimble task;<br />
And though I grow crooked with stooping to pound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yet merry's the sound</span><br />
As with block and with hammer I journey round<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">And round and round.</span><br />
<br />
I am the cooper: I bind the cask:<br />
Am healthy and happy&mdash;what more shall I ask?<br />
Not in king's palaces, I'll be bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Such joy is found,</span><br />
Where men do nothing, and still go round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And round and round.</span><br />
<br />
So I'll still be a cooper, and bind the cask:<br />
Bread for children and wife is all I ask;<br />
And glad will they be at night, I'll be bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That, with cheerful sound,</span><br />
Father all day went a-hammering round,<br />

<h2>"GOOD-MORNING, SIR!"</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a little robin that grew to be so tame,
that it would come to my sister Helen's door every morning
for a few crumbs. Sometimes it would perch on the table.</p>

<p>What a power there is in kindness! It is very pleasant
to form these friendships with birds; so that they learn to
trust you and to love you. The sound of the human voice
often seems to have a strange effect on animals, as if they
almost understood your words.</p>

<p>My sister would say, "Good-morning, sir! Come in!
Don't make yourself a stranger. Hard times these; but
you will find plenty of crumbs on the table. Don't be
bashful. You don't rob us. Try as you may, you can't
eat us out of house and home. You have a great appetite,
have you? Oh, well, eat away! No cat is prowling round."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The little bird, as if he knew that my sister was talking
to him, would chirp away, and seem quite happy. As soon
as the warm weather came, his visits were not so frequent;
but, every now and then, he would make his appearance, as
if to say, "Don't forget me, Helen. I may want some more
crumbs when the cold weather comes."</p>

<h2>PLAYING APRIL-FOOL.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the last evening in March, and raining drearily
out of doors; but in mamma's sitting-room all was bright,
warm, and cosey. Jim and his big brother Rob were
stretched out on the rug, feet in the air, watching the
blazing fire, and talking of the tricks they meant to play
next day.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Rob, "you can't fool me! I know about
every way there is of fooling; and I'd just like to see anybody
try it on me!" And Rob rolled over on his back, and
studied the ceiling with a very defiant air.</p>

<p>Poor little Jim looked very much troubled; for, if Rob
said he could not be fooled, of course he couldn't be; and
he did want to play a trick on Rob so badly! At last he
sprang up, saying, "I'm going to ask mamma;" and ran
out of the room. Rob waited a while; but Jim did not
come back: so he yawned, stretched, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning, bright and early, up jumped Jim, pulled
on his clothes; wrong-side out and upside down (for he
was not used to dressing himself), and crept softly downstairs.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, Rob went slowly down, rubbing his
eyes. He put on his cap, and took up the pail to go for
the milk; but it was very heavy. What could be the
matter with it? Why, somebody had got the milk already.
Just then, Jim appeared from behind the door, crying,
"April Fool! April Fool! You thought I couldn't fool
you; but I did."</p>

<p>Rob looked a little foolish, but said nothing, and went
out to feed his hens. To his great surprise, the biddies
were already enjoying breakfast; and again he heard little
Jim behind him, shouting, "April Fool! April Fool!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Rob! He started to fill the kitchen wood-box; but
Jim had filled it. Jim had filled the water-pails: in fact,
he had done all of Rob's work; and at last, when he
trudged in at breakfast-time, with the sugar that Rob had
been told to bring from the store the first thing after breakfast,
Rob said, "I give up, Jim. You have fooled me well.
But such tricks as yours are first-rate, and I don't care how
many of them you play."</p>

</div>

<p>A long, long way from here, there is a country called
Norway. It is a very cold
country, and very rocky;
and there are a great many
small islands all around it.
It is on these islands that
the dear little eider-ducks
build their nests. They
take a great deal of time
and trouble to make them,
and they use fine seaweed, mosses, and dry sticks, so as to
make them as strong as they can.</p>

<p>When the mother-duck has laid four or five eggs, which
are of a pretty, green color, she plucks out some of the soft
gray down that grows on her breast, to cover them up, and
keep them warm, while she goes off to find some food.</p>

<p>And now what do you think happens? Why, when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
comes back to sit on her eggs, she finds that all her eggs and
beautiful down have been taken away! Oh! how she cries,
and flaps her wings, to find her darling eggs gone!</p>

<p>But, after a while, she lays five more, and again pulls the
down out of her dear little breast to cover them. She goes
away again; and again the people take the down away.</p>

<p>When she returns the second time, her cries are very sad
to hear; but, as she is a very brave little duck, she thinks
she will try once more; and this time she is left in peace,
and when she has her dear little children-ducks around her,
you may be sure she is a joyful mamma.</p>

<p>So this is where the eider-down comes from; and, as
there are a great many ducks, the people get a great deal
of down; and with this down are made the quilts which
keep us so warm in cold winter-nights.</p>

<p>The eider-down quilts are very light and warm; but I
always feel sorry for the poor mamma-duck.</p>

<h2>THE TRIAL-TRIP</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Davie</span> and Harold are two little Boston boys. They are
brothers. Last summer, they had two pretty little yachts
given them by a friend. Then they had a launch in the
bath-tub; and their mamma named the yachts, breaking a
bottle of water (a small medicine-bottle) over the bows.
Davie's yacht was named the "West Wind;" and Harold's,
the "Flyaway."</p>

<p>One afternoon, the boys went to City Point, hired a
row-boat, and rowed out about halfway to Fort Independence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
where they put the little vessels into the water for a
trial-trip. It was a pretty sight to see the sails fill with the
wind, and the tiny yachts ride the waves as if they meant
to go to China before they stopped.</p>

<p>The "West Wind" beat the "Flyaway," and I regret to
say that Davie taunted his brother with the fact, and made
him cry; for Harold is a boy that takes every thing to
heart.</p>

<h2>SWADDLING-CLOTHES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> the little readers of "The Nursery" ever think how
thankful they should be for the free use of their arms and
legs? I do not believe it ever came into their thoughts
that there could be any other way than to use them freely.
But in Syria, a country many miles from here, the mothers
do not let their babies kick their feet, and hold out their
dear little hands. They are bound very closely in what are
called "swaddling-clothes."</p>

<p>They are seldom undressed, and are kept in a rough
cradle, and rocked to sleep as much as possible. When the
mother carries them out, she straps them to her back; and
often, on the mountains there, one may see a woman with a
baby on her back, and a great bundle of sticks in her arms.</p>

<p>With the sticks she makes her fire, in a room where there
is no chimney, and where the smoke often makes poor
baby's eyes smart; but all he can do, poor swaddled child,
is to open his mouth, and cry.</p>

<p>This custom of binding the baby up so straight and tight
is a very old one. The Bible tells us, you know, that the
mother of Jesus "wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and
laid him in a manger." So the people of Syria keep on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
using swaddling-clothes, thinking, that, if they do not, the
baby will grow crooked.</p>

<p>They are used in Russia also, and in other countries of
northern Europe. Poor babies! We pity them.</p>

<h2>FANNY AND LOUISE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> was a little pony, and Louise was a little girl.
Fanny had a long black mane and tail, and Louise had long
brown curls. Louise wore a gypsy-hat with blue ribbons,
and Fanny wore a saddle and bridle with blue girths and
reins.</p>

<p>Louise was a gentle little girl, and Fanny was a very headstrong
pony; consequently Fanny had it all her own way.
When she was trotting along the road, with Louise on her
back, if she chanced to spy a nice prickly thistle away up
on a bank, up she would scramble, as fast as she could go,
the sand and gravel rolling down under her hoofs; and, no
matter how hard Louise pulled on the reins, there she would
stay until she had eaten the thistle down to the very roots.
Then she would back down the bank, and trot on.</p>

<p>Fanny was fond of other good things besides thistles.
She would spy an apple on a tree, no matter how thick the
leaves were; and, without waiting to ask Louise's permission,
she would run under the tree, stretch her head up among
the branches, and even raise herself up on her hind-legs, like
a dog, to reach the apple.</p>

<p>Louise would clasp Fanny around the neck, and bury her
face in her mane: but she often got scratched by the little
twigs; and many a long hair has she left waving from the
apple-boughs after such an adventure.</p>

<p>Whenever Fanny smelled any very savory odor issuing
from the kitchen, she would trot up, and put her head in at
the window, waiting for Biddy to give her a doughnut or
cooky. One day a boy named Frank borrowed Fanny, as
he wished to ride out with a little girl from the city. As
they were passing a farm-house, Fanny perceived by the
smell that some one was frying crullers there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/illus147.png" width="269" height="350" alt="Fanny and Louise" title="" />
</div>

<p>She immediately ran down the lane to the house, and
stuck her head in at the open window, and would not stir
from the spot until the farmer's wife gave her a cruller.
Then she went quickly back to the road, and behaved very
properly all the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Fanny was such a good pony, with all her tricks, that the
neighbors often used to borrow her. This Fanny did not
think at all fair; and she soon found a way to put a stop to
it. One warm summer day, the minister borrowed her in
order to visit a sick man about two miles away. After
several hours he returned, very warm and tired, walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
through the dust, and leading Fanny, who came limping
along, holding down her head, and appearing to be very
lame.</p>

<p>She had fallen lame when only half-way to the sick man's
house; and the good old minister had led her all the way,
rather than ride her when she was lame. All the family
gathered around Fanny to see where she was hurt, when
Fanny tossed her head, kicked up her heels, and pranced off
to the stable, no more lame than a young kitten. It had
been all a trick to punish the minister for borrowing her.
And it succeeded; for he never asked for Fanny again.</p>

<h2>TRUE STORY OF A BIRD.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day last spring, in looking over the contents of
some boxes which had long been stowed away in the attic,
I found some pieces of lace, which, though old-fashioned,
seemed to me very pretty. But they were yellow with
age,&mdash;quite too yellow for use.</p>

<p>I took them to the kitchen, and, after a nice washing,
spread them on the grass to bleach. I knew that the bright
sun would soon take away their yellow hue.</p>

<p>A day or two after, Johnnie came running in, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"Auntie, the birds are carrying off all your old rags out
there," pointing to the place where the laces were spread.
Out I went to see about my "old rags," as he called them;
and I found that several pieces were missing. We knew
that the birds must have taken them; but, where to look
for them, we could not tell.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Johnny invited me and his cousins to take
a row with him in his boat to Rocky Island, of which the
readers of "The Nursery" have heard before. We were
all glad to go. As we were passing some bushes on the
bank of the river, one of us spied something white among
them. We wondered what it could be.</p>

<p>Johnny rowed nearer; and we could see that it was a
piece of lace. Rowing nearer still, we saw another piece,
and another, and at the same time heard the flutter of
wings. We then asked to be landed, and our boatman soon
brought us to shore in fine style.</p>

<p>On parting the bushes, we saw a nest just begun, and a
piece of lace near it, but not woven in. Close by were four
other pieces; but they were all caught by the little twigs, so
that the bird could not get them to the nest. We took the
lace off carefully, leaving the nest as it was, and brought it
away with us.</p>

<p>On returning to the house, the children measured the
lace, and found nearly six yards, the largest piece being
about two yards. It seemed quite a lift for the little birds;
and it was too bad that after all they did not get the use
of it. But do you think they were discouraged?</p>

<p>Oh, no! for they soon had a nice nest built; and one
day Johnny found an egg in the nest, which, from its bright
hue, he knew to be a robin's egg. This was followed by
other eggs, and, in due time, by a whole brood of young
birds.</p>

<p>Tom, the baker's boy, and a

on. "What is it?" asks
Ann at sight of the picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He is well pleased with his

looking around the corner of
the wall does not look pleased
in the least.</p>

<p>It is plain that he has no love
for the fine arts. Or it may be
that he does not like to see such
a rough sketch on his wall.</p>

<p>Perhaps he thinks that when
boys are sent on an errand,
they ought not to loiter by the

<h2>PETER'S PETS.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> old are they, Peter?" asked Ralph Lamson, pointing
to two little guinea-pigs on a rude cage which Peter
had himself made.</p>

<p>"I've had them about six weeks," said Peter. "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
know how old they were then; but they were only little
things: they've grown twice as big since I've had them."</p>

<p>"What do you give them to eat?" asked Edwin Moore.</p>

<p>"Oh! all sorts of things," replied Peter. "They're fond
of carrots, apples, and all sorts of green leaves, and, what
is queer, they are fond of tea-leaves."</p>

<p>"Fond of tea-leaves!" cried Ralph and Edwin.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, "they like tea-leaves very much. I
give them oats too, and bits of bread."</p>

<p>"And what do they drink?" asked Edwin.</p>

<p>"They don't want much to drink, if they get plenty of
green stuff and tea-leaves," said Peter; "but they like a
drop of milk now and then, if they can get it."</p>

<p>"Where do these animals come from?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"From Brazil and Paraguay in South America. It is
thought that their odor drives away rats; and that is one
reason why we keep them."</p>

<p>"What will you sell them for?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't sell them!" said Peter. "They are my pets.
Funny little fellows they are, and not so stupid as they
seem. This white one I call Daisy; and the other I call
Dozy, because he sleeps a good deal."</p>

<h2>THE STROLLING BEAR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> St. Paul, one day last winter, a big black bear was
seen strolling along on the sidewalk on Third Street. He
seemed to be quite at his ease, and would stop now and
then, and look in at the shop-windows.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men and boys soon gathered behind him,
following him at a safe distance. Others, going up and down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the street, would stop to learn the cause of the crowd, and
perhaps join it, so that they might see the end of the fun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus155.png" width="500" height="380" alt="The bear" title="" />
</div>

<p>For a while, Bruin did not seem to care much for the
crowd. But they grew to be pretty free in their speech,
calling out to him, "Does your mother know you're out?"
"Will you take a glass of whiskey?" and making other
rude remarks. Bruin stood it for a while, then turned
fiercely upon the crowd, who scattered at once, some running
into shops, and others down the side-streets.</p>

<p>This free-and-easy bear then continued his stroll. But
the crowd behind him grew larger and larger, and he again
turned upon them, and made them run, all laughing and
shouting, in various directions.</p>

<p>At last, as if he had had enough of this kind of fun, he
quickened his pace, driving five or six fellows into a saloon,
while he followed close at their heels. The boys on the
other side of the street laughed at this: so he crossed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
street quickly, and put them to flight; and the way they
all ran was fun for those near the saloon, who were now
the laughers, in their turn.</p>

<p>At last, a man with whom Bruin was well acquainted, and
on good terms, came up, with a chain in his hand, and threw
it about the bear's neck; and then, as if he had had quite
enough of a stroll, Bruin quietly followed his guide, and was
led back to his owner.</p>

<h2>THE PARROT AND THE SPARROW.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the "Jardin des Plantes," a famous garden and museum
in Paris, there was once a parrot that took a great fancy to
a little wild sparrow.</p>

<p>Every morning, the little bird would fly to the parrot's
perch; and there it would sit almost all day by the side of
its great friend. Sometimes the parrot would raise his unchained
claw, and the sparrow would perch upon it.</p>

<p>Jacquot,&mdash;that was the parrot's name,&mdash;holding the
sparrow at the end of his claw, would turn his head on one
side, and gaze fondly on the little bird, which would flap its
wings in answer to this sign of friendship. Then Jacquot
would slide down to his food-tin, as if to invite the sparrow
to share his breakfast.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/illus157.png" width="289" height="400" alt="THE PARROT AND THE SPARROW." title="" />
</div>

<p>Once the parrot was ill for some days. He did not eat:
he trembled with fever, and looked very sad. The sparrow
tried in vain to cheer him up. Then the little bird flew out
into the garden, and soon returned, holding in his beak some
blades of grass. The parrot with great effort managed to
eat them. The sparrow kept him supplied with grass; and
in a few days he was cured.</p>

<p>Once, when the sparrow was hopping about on the grassplot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
near the parrot's perch, a cat sprang out from some
bushes. At this sight, Jacquot raised a loud cry, and broke
his chain to fly to the aid of his friend. The cat ran away
in terror; and the little bird was saved.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As he frisked to the brook,</span><br />
And gazed at himself in the water so clear!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He looked with delight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">At the beautiful sight;</span><br />
For all was so perfect, from tail-tip to ear!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That noon, our gray fox</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Called on good Farmer Knox,</span><br />
Where some of the fattest of poultry was kept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And, sly as a mouse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lay in wait by the house;</span><br />
Or, peeping and watching, he stealthily crept.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He felt very sure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He should shortly secure</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>A fat little chicken, or turkey, or goose;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And his eyes were as bright</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As the stars are at night,</span><br />
As he tried to decide which his foxship should choose.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">From his sharp-pointed nose</span><br />

He was all expectation!&mdash;when, suddenly "<i>Snap!</i>"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With a "<i>click</i>" and a "<i>clack</i>;"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And, before he could wink,</span><br />
This smart little fox was caught fast in a trap.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And now that gray fox</span><br />

And just what his fate was I never have learned:<br />

He left there one morning&mdash;and never returned.<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
